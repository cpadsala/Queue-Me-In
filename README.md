QmeIn - A Virtual 'Q' for All

Technologies Used:

Node.js, Express Framework, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Handlebars, HTML 5, CSS 3


Description:

QmeIn web application is designed for users to free themselves from the constraints of a physical line. QmeIn is a virtual queue that no longer requires the user to be present at a real queue at all times. With the tap of a button, a user places themselves in a virtual queue which proceeds as a real queue. Whether the queue is at the DMV, a bank, a restaurant, a stadium ticket counter, a parking lot, our own Titan bookstore, or the countless other locations that require people to stand in line, QmeIn will seamlessly do the waiting for the user. 


Process: 

QmeIn provides the user with a list of merchants who have queues currently open. The user can select a specific merchant and queue themselves in with a simple tap of the 'QmeIn' button. Once the user queues in, they are entered into a virtual queue and notified of their position, as well as an estimated time to the point of transaction. The user will, thus, be free from having to be present and waiting in a physical line allowing them to multi-task, or simply relax. As the queue proceeds, the user will be notified through an SMS when they are third from the point of transaction, thus giving them ample time to proceed to the physical line to complete their transaction. 

When a merchant logs in to QmeIn, they are provided with a list of users currently in queue and the time elapsed on the current transaction. Once the merchant has completed the transaction with the current user, they will tap the 'Complete' button and remove that user from the queue. The queue then proceeds forward with the next user. 


Highlights:

Before even entering a virtual queue, QmeIn provides information to the user on how many people are in the current queue for a merchant, as well as, their average time of transaction. This information can guide users to prudently allocate their time. 

Users are not bound to a queue, just as a physical line, they can walk away from their position in line. In QmeIn, the user has the option to simply tap 'QmeOut' and walk away from the queue in a single step.


Future:

QmeIn will provide not only an effortless means to get in a queue for the user, but it will also provide critical data to merchants. As the number of queues and users within them increase, merchants will be able to obtain more accurate times of transaction for each user. The merchant will also become aware of time periods which occupy the highest number of transactions and the lowest. Furthermore, as 'QmeOut' data aggregates, the merchant will know when the highest number of users are lost to wait times. All this real-time data provided from QmeIn will guide merchants to more efficiently manage their labor and other assets.  


Conclusion:

As software etches itself as a required element of our daily livelihood, QmeIn continues this momentum with an abstraction of reality. QmeIn manipulates the physical sense in a virtual environment to give physical freedom to its user. The web app removes constraints allowing users to allocate their physical being at their discretion and benefit.
