About:											                      
QmeIn Web Application allows individuals to digitally queue themselves into a line. This gives individuals the freedom to be away from the local environment from where the physical transaction will occur. Thus, freeing the individual to complete other tasks until the time of transaction. QmeIn Web Application will send notice(s) prior to transaction time, prompting the individual to arrive at the transaction location.

Environment, etc...: 
This project is built through Javascript using Node.JS and ExpressJS. The website pages uses the Handlebars templating engine with Bootstrap for frontend. The web application uses MongoDB 3.4 for data storage and the Mongoose package to work with Node.js. Everything is in the node_modules directory; however, in the future we will not upload the node_modules folder to reduce the download size.
